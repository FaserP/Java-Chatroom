This is a modified distribution of the Apache River project release 2.2.2.  

It has been modified by Dr Gary Allen, University of Huddersfield.

The original release and complete information on Apache River can be found on the Apache Software Foundation website at: http://river.apache.org/

This distribution has been modified to contain the following additional files and scripts:
	apache-river-2.2.2/examples/hello/policy.all
	  -  a simple java policy file
	apache-river-2.2.2/examples/hello/start-all-services.sh
	  -  a script to start the services necessary to run a JavaSpace
	apache-river-2.2.2/examples/hello/scripts/jrmp-outrigger-group.sh
	  -  a script to start the JavaSpace
	apache-river-2.2.2/examples/hello/scripts/jrmp-mahalo-group.sh
	  -  a script to start the transaction manager

Also, the following scripts:
	apache-river-2.2.2/examples/hello/scripts/jrmp-reggie.sh
	apache-river-2.2.2/examples/hello/scripts/jrmp-outrigger-group.sh
	apache-river-2.2.2/examples/hello/scripts/jrmp-mahalo-group.sh

have been further edited to add the following JVM argument to the 'java' command:
	-Djava.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly=false

This is a bit of a hack to fix the problem introduced by changes to the Java RMI framework in Java 1.7.21 and above.  See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/enhancements-7.html for more details.


PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS DISTRIBUTION.
